Patched fork of South, a Django application to provide schema and data migrations for Prowl. Written by Montana Mendy.

Make sure you have pip installed then actually install south via  
<pre>pip install South</pre>

If you got south from GitHub or a third party source, you can install via 

<pre>python setup.py install</pre>

You should now have Django South system wide. If you need more information, read the south documentation here, with the first tutorial.
